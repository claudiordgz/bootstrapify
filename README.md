This is the project to post process the HTML generated by LaTeX, the idea would be to process
Tidy2's results, clean the HTML based on that, and then rerun Tidy2 to get the HTML in a pretty good shape.

Version 1.0.0 Working, no dependencies except C++11

Haven't compiled on gcc, just visual c++ for now. The code is ready for some build system.

How to run?

Clone in your system. 
Get an html from your nearest html generated by LaTeX, our current one is the one generated
by the [*GoodrichTamassiaGoldwasser* from the **Study Series**.](https://github.com/claudiordgz/GoodrichTamassiaGoldwasser/tree/gh-pages)
